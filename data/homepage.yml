# about
about:
  enable: true
  title: "About Me"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I usually find myself drifting toward the ocean, the views are stunning.
    I am passionate about learning and sharing knowledge - ideally I would be teaching cyber security,
    however I still have a lot to learn. In my spare time I enjoy working out and
    catching up on the latest tech news.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My areas of focus lie in leadership and development. I enjoy coding, and finding innovative ways 
    to break into systems in order to secure them just as much as I enjoy team-work, which 
    enables me to iterate, ergo improving on the processes in order to reach business goals.
